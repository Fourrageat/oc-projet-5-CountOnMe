 # CountOneMe - Calculator Documentation

 ## Overview

 The `Calculator` class is a Swift model responsible for performing arithmetic calculations based on user input in the CountOneMe calculator app.

 ## Class Structure

 - **Class Name:** `Calculator`
 - **Inherits from:** `NSObject`

 ## Properties

 - `operatorsOrderPriority: [[String]]`: Defines the order of operator priority for calculations.

 ## Methods

 ### `calculateResult(from elements: [String]) -> String?`

 Calculates the result of the given expression.

 - **Parameters:**
   - `elements: [String]`: An array of string elements representing the mathematical expression.
 - **Returns:**
   - `String?`: The result of the calculation or `nil` if an error occurs.

 ### Private Methods

 #### `handleOperations(of operators: [String], in operations: inout [String])`

 Handles operations based on the given priority and modifies the array of operations in place.

 #### `performCalculation(left: Int, usedOperator: String, right: Int) -> String`

 Performs the arithmetic calculation based on the left operand, operator, and right operand.

 - **Parameters:**
   - `left: Int`: The left operand.
   - `usedOperator: String`: The operator to be applied.
   - `right: Int`: The right operand.
 - **Returns:**
   - `String`: The result of the calculation or an error message.

 ## Implementation Notes

 - The class follows a simple order of operations: multiplication and division first, followed by addition and subtraction.
 - Calculation errors are handled and returned as a string "Error."
